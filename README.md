# Pokémon API Project

This project leverages the [Pokémon API](https://pokeapi.co/) — a unique, comprehensive API that integrates multiple data sources related to the Pokémon universe into a single API.

With this API, you can retrieve detailed information about:

- **Pokémon** (e.g., stats, abilities, and moves)
- **Abilities** (e.g., effects, which Pokémon have them)
- **Moves** (e.g., descriptions, power, and which Pokémon can learn them)
- **Types** (e.g., Fire, Water, Electric, etc.)
- And much more, all from a single, unified API endpoint!

## Features

- Fetch detailed information about a specific Pokémon by name or ID.
- View Pokémon stats, abilities, moves, and types in one request.
- Easily search by Pokémon name, ID, or type.
- Retrieve abilities and moves for different Pokémon.
- Efficient integration by combining multiple data sources under one API.
